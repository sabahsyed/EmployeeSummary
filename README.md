# Employee Summary

## Introduction
 The application will prompt the user for information about the team manager and then information about the team members. The user can input any number of team members, and they may be a mix of engineers and interns. This assignment has all passed unit tests. When the user has completed building the team, the application will create an HTML file that displays a nicely formatted team roster based on the information provided by the user. 

 ## Guidelines

 * Use the Inquirer npm package to prompt the user for their email, id, and specific information based on their role with the company. For instance, an intern may provide their school, whereas an engineer may provide their GitHub username.

 
* The app will run as a Node CLI to gather information about each employee.
* The dependencies are, jest for running the provided tests, and inquirer for collecting input from the user.

## Minimum Requirements

* Functional application.

* GitHub repository with a unique name and a README describing the project.

* User can use the CLI to generate an HTML page that displays information about their team.

* All tests must pass.

### User input
The project must prompt the user to build an engineering team. An engineering team consists of a manager, and any number of engineers and interns.

### Roster output
The project must generate a team.html page in the output directory, that displays a nicely formatted team roster. Each team member should display the following in no particular order:

* Name
* Role
* ID
* Role-specific property (School, link to GitHub profile, or office number)
